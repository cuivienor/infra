# Notes

This directory contains working notes and scratchpad content.

## Structure

- **wip/**: Work in progress notes and current status tracking
- **ideas/**: Future ideas, brainstorming, experimental thoughts

## Guidelines

- Keep it casual and messy - this is your thinking space
- Move content to docs/ when it becomes formal/stable
- Clean up completed WIP items periodically
- Date your notes for easy tracking
