## Project Notes

## Homelab Media Pipeline - Complete Architecture Plan Created

Created comprehensive plan in homelab-media-pipeline-plan.md after extensive research.

### Key Decisions
- **Hybrid approach**: Both containers privileged (ripper + transcoder)
- **Media user**: UID/GID 1000 across all containers and host
- **Recreate transcoder**: Start fresh, remove idmap complexity
- **Community patterns**: Following proven practices from community-scripts repo

### Research Completed
1. Analyzed Proxmox community scripts (Tdarr, Jellyfin, Plex patterns)
2. Studied build.func for hardware passthrough patterns
3. Confirmed privileged vs unprivileged trade-offs
4. Identified standard UID/GID conventions (1000 is industry standard)

### Plan Contents
- Phase 1: Host-level media user setup
- Phase 2: Recreate transcoding container as privileged
- Phase 3: Install software (ffmpeg, HandBrake, GPU drivers)
- Phase 4: Test transcoding workflow
- Phase 5: Create MakeMKV ripper container
- Phase 6: Installation scripts following community patterns
- Phase 7: Generic container setup documentation

### Next Session
User will continue in different session. Plan document is complete and ready to execute.
All research findings, decisions, and step-by-step instructions documented.
